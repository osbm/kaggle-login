  workflow_dispatch: # manually trigger the action
  push: # automatically trigger the action when a new commit is pushed to the repo


jobs:
  testitout:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Login to Kaggle
      - uses: osbm/kaggle-login@main
        with:
          KAGGLE_USERNAME: {{ secrets.KAGGLE_USERNAME }}
          KAGGLE_KEY: {{ secrets.KAGGLE_KEY }}

      - name: Use kaggle api to list datasets
